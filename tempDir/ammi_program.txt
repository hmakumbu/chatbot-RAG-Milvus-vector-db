### African Master's in Machine Intelligence (AMMI)

#### Program Overview
The African Master's in Machine Intelligence (AMMI) is a flagship program in Machine Learning in Africa. It aims to train experts in AI and create a network of researchers and professionals, with support from technology companies such as Facebook and Google. The program emphasizes both theoretical and practical modules to provide high-quality education to a diverse cohort of students.

AMMI is a new, fully-funded intensive one-year study program that offers advanced training in machine learning and its applications to bright young Africans. Founded by Moustapha Cissé, Head of the Google AI Center in Accra, Ghana, AMMI aims to bring world-class AI education to Africa and foster a robust ecosystem of AI practitioners committed to making a positive societal impact.

In September 2018, the African Masters of Machine Intelligence (AMMI) was launched at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS) with the generous sponsorship of Facebook and Google, along with strong support from the global AI community. Initially implemented at AIMS Rwanda and AIMS Ghana, AMMI has expanded to AIMS Senegal, welcoming its inaugural cohort of 39 students (including 33% women) in January 2021.
